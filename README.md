1. mention various strategies to spread the best practices/ new research /innovation/discoveries to the common people.
 
Even though the information ( Hospital name , hospital address , covid beds , oxygen  beds with variation like some are providing only covid beds while some are not providing address etc )is made available to citizens on state government websites, most of them have scattered information, have different formats, use different interfaces and are not accessible to citizens because of inconsistent user interfaces. It is here, we developed the COVINET website that mines important Covid-19 information useful to citizens from almost 13 official State and 100's of district Government websites with a consistent and intuitive user interface. 
 
We propose to route the COVINET system through Government channels (websites, social media) for further reach and scalability. To improve the authenticity and faster update of data on the system, we request the Central Government to connect us with health departments of the state governments. 

In addition, we will be happy to improve the application further with funding support. 


 
2. Area of research

Covid Essentials, Reliable Information on Covid-19 and Healthcare Sector



3. Brief description of research activity in 100 words 

As this pandemic unfolds at unprecedented scales in India, the public is at a loss to find the necessary medical resources to help the afflicted. Unfortunately, this information (hospital, oxygen and bed details) is scattered across various government and private platforms, which lack an understandable centralization of state-wise data. Moreover, the said platforms lack real-time updating of data. We have tried to make an integrated dashboard with authentic information along with other important details and functionality that are missing anywhere else. The UI part is very user friendly for the improved experience and convenience of the user.Finally, the platform is also linked to a dedicated API (Application Programming Interface) page for others to use.The said API has been exclusively designed by our team. 



4. Outcome/Output of the research
 
 If implemented properly and brought and informed in public, this could save many lives, along with transparency with an improved user experience. This will save the time of the people as it is a centralized dashboard with a lot of other information, one doesn't have  to switch between multiple websites. The search box is added with filters with which one can get exactly what he wants.
 
 
 
5. any future plans to do CoVID-19 related research 

We have plans to add more functionality to the maps which currently have hospitals near me. Also this same can be extended to other domains like the vaccines, oxygen and medicines eventually making it a one stop place for the people in need. We will also include graphs and charts. We can also collaborate with hospitals to directly and dynamically update information from them in real-time.
